# Unraid-VM-Backup-Plugin-Restoration-Script

## Description

A bash script to automate the restoration of a virtual machine that has been backed up with the VM-Backup plugin on a Unraid server

## Why?

The VM Backup plugin is really great it allows you to make backups of your virtual machines, but at the moment it is not possible to restore a backup from the Unraid web interface. That's why I decided to create a small script to automate the restoration of a backup.

## About this repository

I am not an expert in bash script so there are probably many ways to improve this script. I would like to take into account your remarks or improvement if you want to participate to the improvement of this script. I put an MIT license I guess it's just for this kind of project.
